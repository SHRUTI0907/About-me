# Hey there! I'm Shruti 👋

Data is my playground, and code is my canvas. Currently navigating the exciting world of Business Analytics at Columbia, with roots in Information Technology from SRM Institute in Chennai.

## My Tech Journey 🚀
When I'm not wrestling with complex datasets or debugging code, you'll find me:
- Breaking down barriers in tech through the FemCodes Club
- Turning raw data into meaningful stories
- Tutoring math and inspiring young minds

## What I'm Working On
I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of data science. My recent projects include:
- **Skin Cancer Detection Magic** 🩺 
  Leveraging deep learning to transform medical imaging analysis. Because technology should make a real difference.

- **Cracking the Code of Video Game Representation** 🎮
  Diving deep into how gender plays out in gaming – because representation matters.

## My Toolkit 🛠️
Languages that speak my language:
- Python
- SQL 
- HTML
- C/C++

Tools that help me turn ideas into reality:
- Tableau
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
- VS Code (where the magic happens!)

## Beyond the Code
When I'm not in tech mode, I'm:
- Mentoring students
- Exploring the streets of New York
- Constantly learning and growing
